# Vsdsquadron-Mini-Internship
####  The VSDSquadron Mini is a tiny RISC-V development board. It features a 32-bit RISC-V core, multiple clock options, 15 GPIO pins, and various communication ports like SPI and I2C.
# FEATURES 
# Simpler instruction, hence simple instruction decoding.
Instruction comes undersize of one word.
Instruction takes a single clock cycle to get executed.
More general-purpose registers.
Simple Addressing Modes.
Fewer Data types.
A pipeline can be achieved. 








## TASK 1
#### To install the RISC-V toolchain using VDI, write a C code to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to N and analyse the risc assembly code.


### 1.Installation of Virtual Box
